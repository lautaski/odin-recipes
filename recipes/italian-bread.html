    <h2>Wonderful Italian bread made in a bread machine then baked in the oven.</h2>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>4 cups unbleached all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon light brown sugar</li>
        <li>1 1/3 cups warm water (110 degrees F/45 degrees C)</li>
        <li>1 1/2 teaspoons salt</li>
        <li>1 1/2 teaspoons olive oil</li>
        <li>1 (.25 ounce) package active dry yeast</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon water</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons cornmeal</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Place flour, brown sugar, warm water, salt, olive oil and yeast in the pan of the bread machine in the order recommended by the manufacturer. Select dough cycle; press Start.</li>
        <li>Deflate the dough and turn it out onto a lightly floured surface. Form dough into two loaves. Place the loaves seam side down on a cutting board generously sprinkled with cornmeal. Cover the loaves with a damp cloth and let rise, until doubled in volume about 40 minutes. Meanwhile, preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
        <li>In a small bowl, beat together egg and 1 tablespoon water. Brush the risen loaves with egg mixture. Make a single long, quick cut down the center of the loaves with a sharp knife. Gently shake the cutting board to make sure that the loaves are not sticking. If they stick, use a spatula or pastry knife to loosen. Slide the loaves onto a baking sheet with one quick but careful motion.</li>
        <li>Bake in preheated oven for 30 to 35 minutes, or until loaves sound hollow when tapped on the bottom.</li>
    </ol>
